# ðŸ¦– Wiene

Wiene is a simple dependency manager for use with Nix, similar to [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv/)
and [`npins`](https://github.com/andir/npins/).

I made it to solve my own problems, but I hope it can help you too.

Try it out without installing anything permanently by running
`nix run github:Fuwn/wiene`!

## Installation

Follow the installation instructions at [Tsutsumi](https://github.com/Fuwn/tsutsumi).
